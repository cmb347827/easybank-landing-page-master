## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery/Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- I had some trouble with the intro SVGs and from my research, probably because they have the same IDs. I had first added the SVGs embedded inline into the html file.
  I read that for the SVGs to be responsive the width/height need to be removed from the SVG tag and to only use viewBox with width/height values.
  And for the IDs not to clash I should embed the SVGs either using `<img>` or `<object>` 
 
### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
